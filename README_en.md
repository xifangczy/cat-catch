# 📑Introduction
Cat-catch SE is a resource sniffing extension, a modified version of [Cat-catch](https://github.com/xifangczy/cat-catch) that disables the "Opt-out list", making it easier to browse resources on various websites.

💔Cat-catch is open source; anyone can download, modify, and upload it to various platforms. However, there are already many fake Cat-catch versions with added advertising code. Please be very careful about your data security.

# 📒Documentation
Since the development of CatCatch SE is not yet complete, user documentation is temporarily suspended. In the meantime, you can refer to the original CatCatch user documentation:

(Please note that this user documentation is not definitive and is for reference only.)
